{"m1": 2.2708943999999747, "m2": 2.3440828999999894, "reason": "under the condition of test_review(size30) joining with business, the python sort time is 2.256633299999976, while rdd time is 2.2730609000000186. the reason that Python is taking a little bit less time, is because the RDD has to communicate with Spark cluster manager, in order to access some part of data. While the Python list approach is completely on Memory. However, I do believe that as data scale gets larger, the RDD will definitely surpass Python native runtime."}
